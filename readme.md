# CTEC3905 Assignment

- The 4 webpages which are the Assignment are: index.html, art.html, journey-into-midnight.html and artSearch.html. The rest (fashion.html, travel.html, about.html) have been put there to show smooth navigation, but they do not have real content.
- Two posts work; Journey into midnight and The Met Search which bring you to a article page and the API.

# User testing
- I had given my github pages link to a friend to give me feedback on the website, mainly for navigation and to test on their computer and phone. Their feedback:
"The navigation is easy to use with the header being fixed. Only think that you could change is having the met collection api in a clearer place because it’s only on the home page at the moment with the articles so could be easily missed. And on the maintenance pages you could stick the footer to the bottom of the page but that’s just nit picks"
- My response to this was that my api was not a main feature of the website, it doesn't require its own category as it comes under the 'Art' category and the maintenance pages are not part of my 4 pages so I have not put real content into them, they are there for smooth navigation.
