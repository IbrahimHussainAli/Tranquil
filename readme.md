# CTEC3905 Assignment
## Brief points about the assignment
- The website I have chosen to create is a contemporary culture magazine showing art, fashion etc. I tried to give it a minimal aesthetic feel because that's the type of art and photos I'd want on there. The fictional magazine is made to give an all around easy and minimal navigation so you feel "Tranquil" while using the site. Thank you.
- The 4 webpages which are the Assignment are: index.html (Homepage), art.html(Art section), journey-into-midnight.html(Art post) and artSearch.html(The Met post). The rest (fashion.html, travel.html, about.html) have been put there to show smooth navigation, but they do not have real content.
- The homepage was created using CSS Grid, as was the "Art" page, I chose this because once you understand the basics on how it works it can be effective to create a good layout of images or article posts.
- The "Journey Into Midnight" post was also create using CSS grid, I have chosen not to resize all the images but to use the CSS grid to adjust the images to your screen size.
- The "Search The Met Collection now" post allows you to search within The Met's artwork collection and I have chosen to output the title, artist if there is one and the artwork itself.
- I had not understood what branches were until I had finished the website so no branches were made.
- My main bugs were caused by javascript errors which were resolved by trial and error and guidance from the lab examples given to us.

# Code tutorials

- Main use of this link was for javascript tutorials and basic understanding of CSS and HTML [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- To make the nav bar [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp)
- Used to help in understanding CSS grid [Grid By Example](https://gridbyexample.com/)
- Also used to understand CSS grid [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/)
- Used to understand CSS [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
- When I came across errors I used [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- A book which helped me understand basic knowledge of code as this is my first website: HTML & CSS: Design and Build Web Sites by Jon Duckett.
- To code the API I mainly used The Met Github page and the lab sheets.

# User testing
- I had given my github pages link to a friend to give me feedback on the website, mainly for navigation and to test on their computer and phone. Their feedback:

> "The navigation is easy to use with the header being fixed. Only think that you could change is having the met collection api in a clearer place because it’s only on the home page at the moment with the articles so could be easily missed. And on the maintenance pages you could stick the footer to the bottom of the page but that’s just nit picks"

- My response to this was that my api was not a main feature of the website, it doesn't require its own category as it comes under the 'Art' category and the maintenance pages are not part of my 4 pages so I have not put real content into them, they are there for smooth navigation.
